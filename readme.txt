Many thanks to Mateo for the CE toolchain, libraries, and CEmu, all of which made this possible. He also fixed
many bugs for me I found along the way.

Thanks to Tari for all his programming help. I'm bad at C, and he is significantly better :)

Andrew Milne created the art assets, and Kerm modified some sprites to make them look a little better on-screen.
